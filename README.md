# ðŸ“˜ TypeScript Basics Repository

Welcome to the **TypeScript Basics** repository! This project contains foundational TypeScript concepts with simple, well-organized examples to help you understand and practice key features of the language.

## ðŸ“‚ Topics Covered

### âœ… 1. Basic Data Types
- Learn how to declare variables with `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `any`, and other primitive types.

### âœ… 2. Object Literal Types
- Understand how to define structured object shapes using TypeScript's type system.

### âœ… 3. Functions in TypeScript
- Explore how to type function parameters and return values for better safety and clarity.

### âœ… 4. Spread and Rest Operators
- Practice using `...` to spread arrays/objects and gather function arguments with the rest pattern.

### âœ… 5. Destructuring
- Use object and array destructuring with TypeScript annotations for cleaner, more readable code.

### âœ… 6. Type Aliases
- Simplify complex types by creating custom reusable type definitions with `type`.

### âœ… 7. Union and Intersection Types
- Combine types flexibly using `|` (union) and `&` (intersection) for powerful type modeling.

### âœ… 8. Ternary, Optional Chaining & Nullish Coalescing
- Conditionally assign values with the ternary operator.
- Access deeply nested properties safely with optional chaining `?.`.
- Provide fallback values using the nullish coalescing operator `??`.

### âœ… 9. Special Types: `never`, `unknown`, and Nullable Types
- Learn when and how to use `never` (unreachable code), `unknown` (safe counterpart to `any`), and nullable types (`null`/`undefined`).
